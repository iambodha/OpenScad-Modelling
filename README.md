# 🛠️ OpenSCAD Modelling: Vase Creations 🏺

Welcome to the **OpenSCAD Modelling** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning the capabilities of OpenSCAD, a powerful script-based 3D modeling software. As part of this journey, I’ve created three unique vase models inspired by:

- 🔺 **Low-poly geometry**  
- 🌊 **Sine wave patterns**  
- 💎 **Diamond faceting**  

All vase models are available for download here on GitHub and via the Maker Space platform. You can 3D print these vases or use them as inspiration for your own OpenSCAD projects.
